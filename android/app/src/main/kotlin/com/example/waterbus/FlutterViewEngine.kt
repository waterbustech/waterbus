/**
 *  This is an application-specific wrapper class that exists to expose the intersection of an
 *  application's active activity and an application's visible view to a [FlutterEngine] for
 *  rendering.
 *
 *  Omitted features from the [io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity] include:
 *   * **State restoration**. If you're integrating at the view level, you should handle activity
 *      state restoration yourself.
 *   * **Engine creations**. At this level of granularity, you must make an engine and attach.
 *      and all engine features like initial route etc must be configured on the engine yourself.
 *   * **Splash screens**. You must implement it yourself. Read from
 *     `addOnFirstFrameRenderedListener` as needed.
 *   * **Transparency, surface/texture**. These are just [FlutterView] level APIs. Set them on the
 *      [FlutterView] directly.
 *   * **Intents**. This doesn't do any translation of intents into actions in the [FlutterEngine].
 *      you must do them yourself.
 *   * **Back buttons**. You must decide whether to send it to Flutter via
 *      [FlutterEngine.getNavigationChannel.popRoute()], or consume it natively. Though that
 *      decision may be difficult due to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/67011.
 *   * **Low memory signals**. You're strongly encouraged to pass the low memory signals (such
 *      as from the host `Activity`'s `onTrimMemory` callbacks) to the [FlutterEngine] to let
 *      Flutter and the Dart VM cull its own memory usage.
 *
 * Your own [FlutterView] integrating application may need a similar wrapper but you must decide on
 * what the appropriate intersection between the [FlutterView], the [FlutterEngine] and your
 * `Activity` should be for your own application.
